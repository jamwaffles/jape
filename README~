JAPE-0.0.7

All this does is provide a basic OpenGL window with font rendering capability and double buffering. 
it also displays the frames/second and has a function that allows animation to be played at a speed
independant of framerate. also, 0.0.4 now has *some* particle engine functionality (creating points, 
particles, drawing them, updating them (calculating next positions)). 0.0.3 and above has a nice output 
prompt in the opengl window to report any messages using Terminal.print(). the functions then take care of 
scrolling out put/displaying it. 0.0.5 now has the ability to give properties to a point to control 
the direction/speed of the particles to make different effects, like fountains or explosions etc. 
(well, dunno about the explosions. maybe add a function to disable/reenable points). 0.0.6 and above uses
point sprites for faster rendering and particle attenuation - COOL. 

	0.0.6 and above uses GLPNG
	
		sudo apt-get install glpng
		
	have fun :)
