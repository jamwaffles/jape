JAPE-0.0.6

All this does is provide a basic OpenGL window with font rendering capability and double buffering. 
it also displays the frames/second and has a function that allows animation to be played at a speed
independant of framerate. also, 0.0.4 now has *some* particle engine functionality (creating points, 
particles, drawing them, updating them (calculating next positions)). 0.0.3 and above has a nice output 
prompt in the opengl window to report any messages using Terminal.print(). the functions then take care of 
scrolling out put/displaying it. 0.0.5 now has the ability to give properties to a point to control 
the direction/speed of the particles to make different effects, like fountains or explosions etc. 
(well, dunno about the explosions. maybe add a function to disable/reenable points). 

0.0.6 and above uses GLPNG

	sudo apt-get install glpng
	
have fun :)

BENCHMARKS:

Before point sprites and stuff:

	74/75 fps
	
After point sprites and stuff:

	dunno

BUGS:

for some reason a japeEmitter point Y position cant be anything other than zero (craptastic ¬¬) - CHRIIIIIS

KEYS:

E:		enable/disable points
S:		rotate/dont rotate the scene
T:		enable/disable terminal
V:		bomb 1
B:		bomb 2
N:		bomb 3
Q/Esc:	quit
R:		reset roatation
P:		pause/resume simulation

for point sprites: (bad as i cant get attenuation to work)

glEnable(GL_POINT_SPRITE);
glTexEnvi(GL_POINT_SPRITE, GL_COORD_REPLACE, GL_TRUE);
glBegin( GL_POINTS );
{
	for(int z = 0; z < particleCount; z++)
	{	
		glPointSize(EmitterProperties.texsize);
		glColor4f(particles[z].colr, particles[z].colg, particles[z].colb, particles[z].life);
		glBegin(GL_POINTS);
			glVertex3f(particles[z].posx, particles[z].posy, particles[z].posz);
		glEnd();
	}
}
glEnd();glDisable(GL_POINT_SPRITE);
