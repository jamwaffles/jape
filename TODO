JAPE-0.0.6

Add ability to enter things in the Terminal and allow the user to decide when they want a new line or not (\n) - SourceBoost
LCD functions should come in handy for finding '\n's. TODO: also add ablility to output variables. newline function now 
works (sort of)

Add texture support and ability to have it on/off for certain points. on second thoughts, add something that allows a shape 
drawing function (textures, polies, points) to define what the particle looks like. DONE: now uses GLPNG to add textures. 

TODO: POINT SPRITES *DONE*

TODO: MAKE SPRITES GET BIGGER/SMALLER WITH CAMERA DISTANCE - attenuation
