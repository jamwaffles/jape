JAPE-0.0.2

All this does is provide a basic OpenGL window with font rendering capability and double buffering. 
it also displays the frames/second and has a function that allows animation to be played at a speed
independant of framerate. also, 0.0.2 now has *some* particle engine functionality (creating points, 
particles, drawing them, updating them (calculating next positions, although no external paramaters 
can be applied yet)).
